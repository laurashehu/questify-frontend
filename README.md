# 🏜️ Questify

**Gamify Your Productivity** – A Dune-inspired productivity web app that turns your daily tasks into epic quests. Earn XP, level up, and face punishments when you fall behind.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Create and manage tasks like "quests"
- ⏳ Deadlines for each task – fail to complete on time, receive a **random punishment**
- 🧠 Gain XP and level up
- 🏆 Earn **titles** and **badges** as you progress
- ⚙️ Minimal UI: no sidebar, just a clean topbar with progress and status

## 🌌 Inspiration
This project is inspired by the aesthetics and discipline of *Dune*. A world where every task is a test of will, and every action has a consequence.

> "A person’s XP must flow, or they shall fall." – Not Frank Herbert lol

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **React** with **TypeScript**
- **SCSS** for styling
- UI influenced by the sands of *Arrakis* – minimal, sharp, and thematic

## 🚧 Status
Actively in development – frontend only for now.
